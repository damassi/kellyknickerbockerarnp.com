    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Board Certified Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) and have
      been practicing in Washington since 2014. I received my Bachelor of
      Science in Nursing degree and my Master of Science in Nursing degree from
      The University of Texas Health Science Center with a specialty in
      psychiatric nursing where I began my career. My research synthesis focused
      on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) which illustrated the efficacy
      one may achieve through careful assessment and correction of chemical
      imbalances mirroring the benefits of TMS.
    </p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      My approach optimizes level of connection and building a therapeutic
      alliance in collaboration with other healthcare providers to achieve
      outcomes that impact highest level of care. Seeking out mental health
      optimizes outcomes most positively influenced in conjunction with
      psychotherapy.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to rule out any organic causes that may co-exist with
      presenting symptoms that may or may not be interfering with quality of
      life. This approach enables me to perform the most thorough psychiatric
      diagnostic evaluation and when indicated medication management.
    </p>

    <p>
      I participate within my professional community to ensure continuous
      exposure within my role in psychiatry keeping myself up-to-date with
      implementation of care that focuses on the changes someone is wanting to
      make. In conjunction with my role in private practice the goal of care
      parallels evidenced-based practice modalities through counseling adults
      who often times are seeking out a realistic positive change toward their
      lifelong journey.
    </p>

    <p>
      Self-directed motivation and mutual respect in working together improves
      quality of life supportive within the circumstances an individual endures.
      My goals for treatment are promoting mental health that allow someone to
      work toward the best version of themselves in an outpatient setting. As a
      Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner I actively participate in advocating for
      each individual in efforts to achieve collaborative continuity of care by
      looking at the whole person.
