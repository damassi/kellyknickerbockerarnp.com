    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Board Certified Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner (PMHNP) and have
      been practicing in Washington since 2014. I received my Bachelor of
      Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing degrees from The
      University of Texas Health Science Center with a specialty in psychiatric
      nursing. My research synthesis focused on Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (TMS), illustrating the efficacy one may achieve by mirroring
      the benefits of TMS with careful assessment and correction of chemical
      imbalances.
    </p>

    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>
      My approach prioritizes connection and building the therapeutic alliance,
      in collaboration with other healthcare providers, to optimize outcomes at
      the highest level of care. I believe psychotherapy in conjunction with
      mental health care yields the best possible results.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to rule out any organic causes that may co-exist with
      presenting symptoms and may or may not be interfering with quality of
      life. From this perspective I perform the most thorough psychiatric
      diagnostic evaluation and, if indicated, medication management.
    </p>

    <p>
      I participate consistently within my professional community, keeping
      myself up-to-date on the best methods of care to support clients in making
      desired changes. As in my private practice, I utilize evidenced-based
      modalities to counsel adults who seek realistic positive changes in their
      lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      When an individual navigates challenging circumstances along their
      journey, a supportive collaboration built on mutual respect and
      self-directed motivation improve quality of life. My goal is to promote
      mental health, allowing clients to work toward the best version of
      themselves in an outpatient setting. As a Psychiatric Nurse Practitioner I
      look at the whole person, actively participating in advocacy for each
      individual to achieve collaborative continuity of care.
